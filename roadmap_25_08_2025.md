# ROADMAP – Advanced AI Context Shell Framework 
**Project Start:** 14.05.2025
**Timeline:** 19 August – 30 September 2025  
**Objective:** Build a functional cloud-hosted mini-system based on Semantic OS, AION, PML, PromptX, KIP, and UNCLL – including a multi-agent architecture, independent execution layer, and secure documentation flow.  

---

## Milestones (Overview)
- **M1 (KW 35, 26.08–01.09):** Architecture & protocols for multi-agents defined  
- **M2 (KW 36, 02.09–08.09):** Orchestrator v1 + agent registry + baseline roles operational  
- **M3 (KW 37, 09.09–15.09):** End-to-end “Hello-Multi-Agent” with tools & WhiteBox audit  
- **M4 (KW 38, 16.09–22.09):** Advanced cooperation (Planner/Researcher/Debate) + SCA integration  
- **M5 (KW 39, 23.09–30.09):** Hardening, load testing, independent execution layer, Cloud-Alpha release

## Week by Week Timeline

### ✅ KW 34 — 19–25 Aug 2025 (Preparations)
- Documentation of core systems: AION, KIP, PML, PromptX, Semantic OS, UNCLL✅  
- Hashing of all key artefacts (source code, specifications, blueprints)✅ 
- GitHub private repos set up with `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHECKSUMS_CORE.md`✅  
- Foundation prepared for implementation✅

---

### 📌 25 Aug 2025 — Completion of MPML Development
- Finalization of **MPML Specification v2.1 (Enterprise Edition)**  
- Release of **MPML Sourcecode v2.1 (Runtime Module)** with zero-trust compliance  
- Publication of **Universal Blueprint v2.1** as architectural reference  
- Documentation aligned across specs, source, and whitepapers  
- Integration validated with **PromptX ≥ v3.0, PML ≥ v3.8, KIP ≥ v6.0**  
- All MPML core files archived, hashed (SHA-256), and stored in private repository  

---

### 🧭 KW 35 — 26 Aug – 01 Sep — *M1: Architecture & Protocols*
- Define agent roles: Planner, Executor, Researcher, Critic, Memory, Orchestrator  
- Establish KIP v6.0 schemas for Task, Plan, Evidence, Critique, Result  
- Implement security layer: USER_SAFETY_PROTOCOL, policies, rate control  
- Define persistence via UNCLL + PML bindings (short/long-term memory)  
- Artefacts: `docs/agents/architecture.md`, `protocols/kip_schemas_v1.yaml`  

---

### 🏗 KW 36 — 02–08 Sep — *M2: Orchestrator v1 & Baseline Roles*
- Build **Orchestrator v1**: registry, routing, timeout/retry, backoff logic  
- Implement messaging adapter (KIP v6.0 in-memory bus + future cloud queue)  
- Implement baseline roles: Planner, Executor, Critic, Memory agent  
- Integrate WhiteBox hooks (PROMPTX_WHITEBOX_AUDITOR v1.1)  
- Test: single-hop Planner → Executor → Critic  

---

### 🔗 KW 37 — 09–15 Sep — *M3: End-to-End Execution*
- Implement **Tool Bridge** (PromptX/PML): validation, sandboxing, rate-limits  
- E2E scenario: Goal → Plan → Tool execution → Critic → Result  
- Error tolerance: retry trees, circuit-breaker, fallback strategies  
- Monitoring: latency, success rate, drift score, queue depth  
- Security: injection defense (PML_Semantic_InjectionDefense_Core)  
- Deliverable: full WhiteBox report for E2E flow  

---

### 🧠 KW 38 — 16–22 Sep — *M4: Cooperative Intelligence & SCA*
- Implement cooperation patterns: Planner ↔ Researcher loops, Debate pairs, Critic feedback  
- Apply self-consistency (multiple plan candidates + critic scoring)  
- Integrate **PROMPTX_SEMANTIC_CONTEXT_AMPLIFIER v1.4** + **SCA_KONZEPTVERSTAERKER_AIO v1.4**  
- Define memory policies (episodic vs semantic, TTL, GDPR compliance)  
- Load tests: 100–500 parallel tasks, SLOs (P95 latency < 20s)  

---

### 🛡️ KW 39 — 23–30 Sep — *M5: Hardening & Release Candidate*
- Fault injection tests: agent crashes, network delays, recovery handling  
- Observability suite: dashboards, alerts, audit exports (JSON/MD)  
- Security: least privilege, secret scanning, signed commits/tags  
- Prepare release package: ZIP + SHA-256 checksum + `RELEASE_NOTES.md`  

---

### 🔒 KW 39 — Independent Execution Layer (Detachment Step)
- Isolate core runtime in cloud storage without routing through external LLM APIs  
- Redirect orchestration, context, and memory to **internal Semantic OS modules**  
- Validate PromptX, PML, KIP, AION, UNCLL integration works independently  
- Document procedure in `docs/detachment_procedure.md`  
- Outcome: self-contained execution environment, reproducible and compliant  

---

## 📌 Next Steps — Daily Documentation Routine
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with module changes and commits  
- Extend `ROADMAP.md` with completed milestones and tasks  
- Maintain `/docs/` with versioned specifications  
- Archive daily ZIP backup + SHA-256 checksum in cloud storage  
- Push updates to GitHub repo with signed commits  
- Maintain short daily summary in `DAILY_LOG.md`  

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (End of September 2025)
- **Cloud-Alpha** release achieved  
- All modules interoperable, hash-secured, and documented  
- Multi-agent orchestration stable with audit reports  
- Independent execution layer in place (no external LLM dependency)  
- Daily documentation ensures reproducibility for investors and legal review
